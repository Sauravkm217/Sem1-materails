## QUESTION 1: Define Design Thinking. Explain the need and importance of design thinking.

### Answer:

**Definition of Design Thinking:**
Design Thinking is a human-centered, creative problem-solving approach that focuses on understanding users' needs, redefining problems, and developing innovative solutions through iterative processes such as ideation, prototyping, and testing.

It combines:
- **Empathy** (understanding users)
- **Creativity** (generating ideas)
- **Rationality** (analyzing and refining solutions)

**Five Stages of Design Thinking:**
1. **Empathize** – Understand the user and their problems
2. **Define** – Clearly state the problem
3. **Ideate** – Generate possible solutions
4. **Prototype** – Build a model of the solution
5. **Test** – Evaluate and improve the solution

**Need and Importance:**

1. **Focus on User Needs:** Ensures solutions are built around real user problems, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

2. **Encourages Innovation:** Promotes creative thinking and out-of-the-box ideas.

3. **Improves Problem Understanding:** Helps clearly define complex problems and avoids solving the wrong problem.

4. **Reduces Risk:** Early prototyping and testing reduce chances of failure, saving time and cost.

5. **Supports Collaboration:** Encourages teamwork from different disciplines.

6. **Adaptable to Any Field:** Used in Engineering, Business, Healthcare, Education, and IT.

7. **Improves Decision Making:** Uses feedback and testing for continuous improvement.
